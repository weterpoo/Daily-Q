A binary tree was created by traversing through an array from left to right and inserting each element. 
Given a binary search tree with distinct elements, print all possible arrays that could have led to this 
tree.

Example:
input:
[2, 3, 4, 1]

tree:
		(2)
(1				3)
			(4

output:
[2,1,3,4], [2,3,1,4], [2,3,4,1]
